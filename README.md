This will clone the template and install the required dependencies.

#### Local Development

- clone the repo 

[The Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli) connects to an app in your Partners dashboard. It provides environment variables, runs commands in parallel, and updates application URLs for easier development.

You can develop locally using your preferred package manager. Run one of the following commands from the root of your app.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

You will prompted to login into your partner account , you can create a new app or
connect it an existing app

Open the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development.
